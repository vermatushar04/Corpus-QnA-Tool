# Corpus-QnA-Tool

This repository contains a project that implements a question-answering tool using various data structures and algorithms. It includes header files and corresponding implementation files for managing a dictionary, handling question-answering tasks, and performing search operations efficiently.

## Project Structure

- **`dict.h`**: Header file defining the structure and functions for the dictionary.
- **`qna_tool.h`**: Header file for the question-answering tool functionality.
- **`search.h`**: Header file defining the search-related algorithms.
- **`dict.cpp`**: Implementation of dictionary-related functions.
- **`qna_tool.cpp`**: Implementation of the question-answering tool.
- **`search.cpp`**: Implementation of search algorithms.

## Features

- **Dictionary Handling**: Efficient data structure to manage key-value pairs.
- **Search Algorithms**: Includes various search algorithms for efficient querying.
- **Question Answering Tool**: A tool that uses the dictionary and search algorithms to answer questions.
